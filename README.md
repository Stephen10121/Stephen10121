<h1>Hello, I’m Stephen Gruzin👋</h1>
<p>I'm a Frontend Developer, Creative Facilitator. Meta-Thinker based in Vancouver, WA (Portland area)</p>

<p>I have created and currently manage multiple websites for my clients. This included developing the website, creating a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and deploys the updated site, the backend infrastructure that hosts the services and keeps everything running 24/7, and the networking that connects users to the services.</p>

<p>I specialize in building pixel-perfect, accessible, and responsive web applications that blend technical rigor with creative design. My work spans React, TypeScript, advanced CSS, Docker, Python/pandas, Go, and SvelteKit, with a strong focus on UI/UX best practices, accessibility, and collaborative evaluation frameworks.</p>

<p>I also contribute to the Open Source community by developing libraries that help improve developer experience and UI/UX workflows. <a href="https://windows.stephengruzin.dev" target="_blank">svelte-windows</a> is a draggable and resizable window manager for Svelte that works seamlessly in modern applications.</p>

<p>My favorite pinned project is <a href="https://tailorcal.com" target="_blank">TailorCal</a>. This is a hobby project of mine that eventually turned into a net profit venture.</p>
